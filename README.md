## Summary

Garcia goes into depth about the devlopmental struggles of Palworld, and translates snippets from Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe regarding issues such as working with a low budget, sourcing animation, and swapping from Unity to Unreal Engine 4.

## My Reflections

Despite Palworld's devlopmental process being engulfed by controversy since it's release, receiving a plethora of speculation regarding unethical use of AI as well as potentially infringing on the Pokemon IP, the game's financial success has been equally newsworthy, selling well over 8 million units on steam in the first week. I think that the anecdotes from the Pocketpair CEO highlights the importance of compartmentalization in software development, as well as the need for a flexible team.

While Palworld is certainly not a triple A quality game in terms of graphics or error testing, it is the first open world RPG since Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3(both game award winners in their respective years) I have invested so many hours on in such a short period of time. When I compare Palworld to the likes of Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate, the similarities are quite apparent, the use of a expansive open world with enviromental lore, a map which limits players by levels rather than hard map barriers, as well as a minimalistic UI are all design elements which have been compared and praised against recent AAA studio titles. So despite a somewhat messy development, Palworld is able to find its success with Gamers who are looking for yet another RPG.
